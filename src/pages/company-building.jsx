        <Paragraph>
        Startups come up with new innovative ideas that solve the pain points of customers better than existing solutions. As the younger generation is more likely to try out new offerings, this trend will take away your existing clients, lower your market share and will thereby threaten the existing of your firm. You should not be reactive, but take the initiative to shape your industry and address the future problems of your customers. For that you need the right in-house entrepreneurs. Most companies do neither have an internal innovation department nor the right people to discover good ideas and build up new business models. 
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>

          The goal is to build a ready-to-market startup in this time period. With our Swiss Startup Factory company-building framework, which we have developed over the last three years, and our experience of building up over 50 startups, we can efficiently build-up any company in any industry.

          Further benefits from collaborating with us are our connections to the entire Swiss startup ecosystem, our corporate partners and our own portfolio startups, which we always leverage to test new products and to find synergies.

          <Paragraph className=" white">
          The  lean startup approach (build-measure-learn) assures that we use as little funds as possible to build up the company. Through regular milestones, on which you have the ability to stop the project, your financial risk is mitigated. No superficial projects, full control, no waste of funds – utmost efficiency that leads to agility, speed and clear results.
