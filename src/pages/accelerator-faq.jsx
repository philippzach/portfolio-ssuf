Our goal is: Find remarkable companies with founders we like to work with and spend very intense weeks with them. During the program, we work on everything from finding product market fit, defining a target market to build a solid foundation for future growth.

          <p>We strongly believe in performance indicators. We challenge you in the program, so you should challenge us. Therefore, the amount of equity we receive depends on your assessment of our accelerator program.</p>
                <p>After each milestone you rate our performance. This will result in a combined rating on a scale from A to D after the program with the following meaning:</p>

We believe that the value of the learning, networking, and mentoring offered by the program is of extraordinary value. Our accelerator program will provide you an incredible start and greatly improve your chances for success and sustainability.

In this case, you can keep the cash contribution, which you have received until then and we do not take an equity stake in your company.</p>

          <div className="wrapper"><p>A pre-selected jury, composed of industry specialists, entrepreneurs and founding partners of SSUF, will conduct the milestone reviews. Defining the milestones will be a collaborative effort between the startup and the jury. The milestones are generally the same for everyone, but will be slightly adjusted to each startup’s specific situation and industry.</p>
