          Corporate venturing enables your company to invest in new strategically relevant business models with
           top entrepreneurs who have fresh ideas and thus a different approach to a specific market. Thereby you
            gain competitive advantages such as specialist knowledge in the core business (R&D), learn new know-how
             in processes and partner models (M&A), open up new business opportunities and much more.
